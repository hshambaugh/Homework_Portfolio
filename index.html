   <p>"Hello. My name is Harry Shambaugh. I currently work at FCC Services as a Programer and Analyst. I have been building Business Intelligent Reporting, implementing automation processes, and basic application development for about ten years now.
     My first experience was when I was given my first assignment to make a memo generator.  This application would take a few inputs from a user and based upon the data stored within the memo type would generate the memo and paste it into the last active application on the users screen. 
     It was scary and I doubted I could even do it.  My boss at the time reassured me that I could by simply saying "Harry, your a programmer.  You can do this." From that moment on I was able to overcome my fears and doubts and believe in myself even when others do not.  
     I'm asked a lot about what are my favorite hobbies or things I like to do outside of work.  Don't have any.  Suppose it's just getting caught up on work or just sleeping to get some more energy to go back and work some more.  I find joy in being able to solve problems in 
     creative ways; using the things I learned to apply and adjust when nessearry.  Risk and reward. I heard a story about how there is no gold without the dragon.  It's the idea that it takes risks, and putting yourself in dangerous positions to get the very thing you need.  You see the gold is in a cave guarded by the dragon.  Sometimes you have to go places
    that you don't want to go in order to get those things you need the most.  That is me.  Accepting of those risks and trials in order to grow my mind and character and in return be empowered to make a positive difference in other peoples lives.  I find that gold priceless.</p>
